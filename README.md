abc_templates
=============

Playing around with C++ templates to imitate python's abstract base class collections

The ideas used are based off of parts of Herb Sutter's More Exceptional C++, specifically the section "Extensible Templates: Via Inheritance or Traits?" which can be found online here: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mxc++-item-4.htm

The abstract base classes are defined in abc.h, and and and example is in main.cpp
